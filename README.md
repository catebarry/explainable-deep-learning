AIPI 590 - XAI | Assignment 4: Explainable Deep Learning

This notebook explores model explainability in computer vision using GradCAM and its variants (GradCAM++ and ScoreCAM) applied to a chest X-ray pneumonia classification task.
A pretrained ResNet-50 model was fine-tuned to distinguish Normal vs. Pneumonia X-rays.
Explainability methods were used to visualize which image regions most influenced the modelâ€™s decisions.
